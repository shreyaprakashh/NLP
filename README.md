## üåü What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

NLP combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning to address tasks such as:

- **Text Classification**: Automatically categorizing text into predefined categories.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying entities such as names, locations, and organizations in text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
- **Text Generation**: Creating coherent and contextually relevant text based on input data.
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.

NLP has numerous applications, including chatbots, sentiment analysis tools, translation services, and more.

## üöÄ Features

- **Text Classification**: Classify text into predefined categories using models like Naive Bayes, SVM, and neural networks.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify and classify entities like names, organizations, and locations in text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Text Generation**: Generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on input data using models like GPT and LSTM.
- **Machine Translation**: Translate text from one language to another using sequence-to-sequence models.
